Known Issues – Calculator Application
======================================

#001 – Extra Spaces Around '+' in Exponential Notation in Display
Description: Result display adds spaces around '+' in exponential formats (e.g., '1.2e + 5').
Location: probably formatter.ts
Severity: Low -> Visual inconsistency
Priority: Low

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#002 – Multipel Zeros Are Accepted in Input
Description: Multiple '0's can be typed after an operator (e.g., '5 + 000').
Location: _handleNumber in InputHandler
Severity: Low -> Cosmetic issue. Math.js is resiliant to multiple 0 in an expression, undestands it as one singular 0.
Priority: Low

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#003 – Double Spaces Around Operators in Internal Input Handling
Description: Operators are surrounded by two spaces internally. 
Location: _handleOperator in InputHandler
Severity: Very Low -> Math.js is resiliant to extra spaces. Outputs from InputHandler are fixed by to formatter for display.
Priority: Very Low
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#004 – Preprocessor Wraps Expressions in Extra Parentheses
Description: Already-parenthesized expressions are further wrapped (e.g., '5+(1+1)' → '(5+(1+1))').
Location: preprocess() in preprocessor
Severity: Low -> Math.js is resiliant to extra parentheses. Preprocessed expressions are not used to form output for display in frontend
Priority: Very Low

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#005 – Minus Sign in Result Not Formatted as Unary
Description: Result display formats negative numbers with a space before minus (e.g., '- 5' instead of '-5').
Location: probably formatter.ts
Severity: Low -> Visual inconsistancy
Priority: Low
